# Sign Language Translation Model

Overview

This project aims to create a sign language translation model using MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and Random Forest for training. The model translates sign language gestures representing letters from A to Z into corresponding text.

# Features

Hand Landmark Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe for accurately detecting hand landmarks in images.
Random Forest Classifier: Trains a Random Forest classifier using the positions of hand landmarks extracted from sign language images.
Translation: Translates sign language gestures into text representing letters from A to Z.
Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sign-language-translation.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Prepare your sign language images representing letters from A to Z.
Use MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks in the images.
Extract the positions of hand landmarks and prepare the dataset.
Train the Random Forest classifier using the prepared dataset.
Use the trained model to translate sign language gestures into text.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from mediapipe import MediaPipeHandLandmarkDetector
from randomforest import RandomForestClassifier

# Initialize hand landmark detector
hand_detector = MediaPipeHandLandmarkDetector()

# Detect hand landmarks in sign language images
landmarks = hand_detector.detect_landmarks(image)

# Extract hand landmark positions and prepare dataset
dataset = prepare_dataset(landmarks)

# Train Random Forest classifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier()
classifier.train(dataset)

# Translate sign language gestures into text
text = classifier.translate(landmarks)
print("Translated text:", text)
